# Weather APP using OpeanWeather API

This app uses a free API so i negelected to hide the key. I am planning on buildind a proxy inbetween to practice before I go all in to backend. I'm not a very good frontend designer, but i can make prettymuch whatever I put my mind to... the hard way. Next step is to learn React or some framework and maybe bootstrap. I did all this by hand and it was tediuos but fun, and I;m sure i picked up a lot of bad habits. 

I tried to make this little app responsive and useful. I need to relearn CSS. There is so much I forgot and just hammer at it till it finally submits. Thank you MDN and w3schools. It all got out of hand. What I planned was really simple and this just took off over a couple months into what it is now. If I had planned and had the skills before I did now, I could have done better. Hopefully in 6 months I'll laugh at this. I hand built a widget to allow the user to save locations to get the weather for as many places as they like. This made me want to learn webcomponents. I'm excited about that, but not sure if i should learn that or React first. There is so much to learn. The 48 hour forecast was a nice touch I thought, and I really enjoyed manipuating a 2d array and organizig the elements so it just flowed perfect no matter the length of each day. 

I got into web dev with emphasis on back end. But this is pretty fun and a lot more challenging and rewarding than I'd thought. I'm loving it so far. But I'm a terrible designer. 

I still need to learn webpack, and so much more. I'm actually just doing what I want before I get serious about all this. 

I however did enjoy the JS and tweaking my code to work with all the different API calls. I went a step further and I used the "OneCall" API to get more data to work with. I got that idea from a past student: [Scotty](https://github.com/bscottnz/weather-app). I saw they used it and I liked the fact of doing more. The icons I used were a combination of "scotties" and an awesome library I found that was used by the weather app on my phone. [erik Flowers](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/). I heavily edited some of them, but left most intact.


The more I look at this the more Im dissatisfied with the design. I still have a lot to learn, and
