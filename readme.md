# Weather APP using OpeanWeather API

 Let me preface this with a disclamier:  I am a horrible front end designer, and from the looks of my CSS, I think you'll agree. I learned a little bit and just began using it. I can somewhat get a good effect but man, it's a mess. This was a real feat with the UI. I used way too many media queries but I got it working well. (I can really only attest to my device and the website I used to test other sizes.) Yes, a better frontend man would not stand for this, and redo it! I dont think I'll ever be responsible for building a frontend. I am mostly concerned with the nuts and bolts of designing application code. I have workied on this little app a few hours a week for some time. It has been a blast. But I do agree, this should be redone. I am still cutting my teeth with git. (Wow, branches, and the speed at which I can type "git push origin main", is impressive.)  The amount of and frequency of my commits is probably a red flag to most, but we all learn from doing. 

 I however did enjoy the JS and tweaking my code to work with all the different API calls. I went a step further and I used the "OneCall" API to get more data to work with. I got that idea from a past student: [Scotty](https://github.com/bscottnz/weather-app). I saw they used it and I liked the fact of doing more. The icons I used were a combination of "scotties" and an awesome library I found that was used by the weather app on my phone. [erik Flowers](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/). I heavily edited some of them, but left most intact.

I tried to add all the features I thought would be useful. I tried to mimic a lot of the features of "real" weather apps, with the hopes of creating something I could be proud of. In this endeavor people only really care about what they see and how "cool" it is. You need to be a stufent of WebDav to reall appreciate some of the things I'm trying to do.

I plan to rebuild the design of this app. I think this will be an exceptional project to try and utilize the use of a frontend framework. I'm not looking forward to that, but I need to make the plunge.

## Features
 - Current weather information with:
   - Temperature
   - Weather displaying icon.
   - The Hi and low temps of the day
   - Text description.
 - 8 day forecast containing all the above info for each day.
 - Side by side 48 hour forecast (that I"m still working on. Heres my amitious target.)
   - Desktop design will lay out the days hours horizantally in 3 rows across the page
   - each hours weather will be represented by a weather icon.
    Mobile will be represented in 3 colimns instead. (Doesnt sound too bad.)
   - Hour by hour weather with icons for the next 48 hours.
 - Descriptive background inages that change by the weather.
