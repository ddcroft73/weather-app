# Weather APP using OpeanWeather API

THis app uses a free API so i negelected to hide the key. I am planning on buildind a proxy inbetween to practice before I go all in to backend. I'm not a very good frontend designer, but i can make prettymuch whatever I put my mind to... the hard way. Next step is to learn React or some framework and maybe bootstrap. I did all this by hand and it was tediuos but fun, and I;m sure i picked up a lot of bad habits. 

I still need to learn webpack, and so much more. I'm actually just doing what i want before i get serious about all this. 

I however did enjoy the JS and tweaking my code to work with all the different API calls. I went a step further and I used the "OneCall" API to get more data to work with. I got that idea from a past student: [Scotty](https://github.com/bscottnz/weather-app). I saw they used it and I liked the fact of doing more. The icons I used were a combination of "scotties" and an awesome library I found that was used by the weather app on my phone. [erik Flowers](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/). I heavily edited some of them, but left most intact.


The more I look at this the more Im dissatisfied with the design. I still have a lot to learn, and
