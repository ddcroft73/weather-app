# Weather APP using OpeanWeather API

This app uses a free API so I negelected to hide the key. I am planning on buildind a proxy inbetween to practice before I go all in to backend. I'm not a very good frontend designer
So far this app is only optimized for mobile. It will work on any, but I have to be honest, the CSS turned into  a real nightmare and i'm still trying to dig my way out of it. I built a serch bar that lets you save locations, and I stole a design addition from [Nick Place's](https://github.com/enPlace/top-weather-app) app.

I plan to continue and optimize the look for desktop and tablet view, so it's still being developed. It's taking a lot of patience to continue at this point and not just go straight to learning front-end libraries. But no, apparently I love the frustration.
I still need to learn webpack, and so much more. I'm actually just doing what I want before I get serious about all this. 

I however did enjoy the JS and tweaking my code to work with all the different API calls. I went a step further and I used the "OneCall" API to get more data to work with. I got that idea from a past student: [Scotty](https://github.com/bscottnz/weather-app). I saw they used it and I liked the fact of doing more. The icons I used were a combination of "scotties" and an awesome library I found that was used by the weather app on my phone. [erik Flowers](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/). I heavily edited some of them, but left most intact.


The more I look at this the more Im dissatisfied with the design. I still have a lot to learn, and
